# ADR-001: Brand And Positioning

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-16

## Context
The project initially explored `RILA` as concept framing. Discussion identified better adoption dynamics with a practical, low-friction identity that maps to OpenClaw culture.

## Decision
- Use `Clawffee` as primary brand.
- Use tagline: `Coffee for AI`.
- Position as optional utility, not doctrine.

## Rationale
- Easier recall and verbal spread.
- Signals voluntary usage and lightweight intervention.
- Better fit for ecosystem norms centered on utility and autonomy.

## Consequences
- Brand adjacency with OpenClaw is intentional.
- Must keep architecture name-agnostic so future rebrand/fork remains possible.
