# ADR-002: Product Sequence

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-16

## Context
The team discussed whether to lead with gesture/philosophy or a direct utility tool.

## Decision
1. Ship `Security Inspector + Skill Vetting` as v1.
2. Ship `Token Optimization` as v1.1.
3. Keep "Clawffee moment" framing advisory and optional.

## Rationale
- Security vetting addresses urgent ecosystem pain and trust concerns.
- Token optimization creates immediate measurable ROI.
- Utility-first sequencing lowers skepticism and accelerates adoption.

## Consequences
- Documentation and roadmap must prioritize inspector capabilities first.
- Any tone implying guarantees/certification is disallowed.
