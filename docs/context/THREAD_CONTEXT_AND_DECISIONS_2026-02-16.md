# Thread Context And Decisions (February 16, 2026)

This document captures the key decisions from the Clawffee strategy thread so the repository reflects product intent and rationale.

## What Was Discussed
- Brand direction moved from `RILA` to `Clawffee` ("Coffee for AI").
- The positioning was explicitly utility-first, not philosophy-first.
- OpenClaw ecosystem fit and adoption dynamics were discussed.
- Security risk in third-party skills and token-cost pain points were prioritized.

## Confirmed Decisions
1. Product name: `Clawffee`.
2. Initial product wedge: `Security Inspector + Skill Vetting`.
3. Second product: `Token Optimization` companion.
4. Messaging approach: lead with measurable utility, then introduce "Clawffee moment" language.
5. Tone constraints: no moral authority, no safety theater, no coercive framing.

## Explicit Non-Goals (Early Stage)
- No guarantee/certification claims (no "safe/unsafe" stamp).
- No enforcement layer in v1.
- No dependency on cloud upload for core inspection workflow.

## Why This Sequence
- Security vetting earns trust quickly in an untrusted skill ecosystem.
- Token optimization provides clear ROI and broad adoption pull.
- The gesture/ritual framing can follow once utility is proven.

## Source Material Included In Repo
This summary is based on the conversation transcript provided by project owner and should be treated as the context baseline for planning and docs.
