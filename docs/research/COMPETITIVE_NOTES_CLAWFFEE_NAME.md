# Competitive Notes: Existing "Clawffee" Projects

## Observation
Other repositories using the name "Clawffee" exist and appear focused on Twitch/chatbot plugin ecosystems rather than OpenClaw skill vetting and token optimization.

## Relevance
- Name overlap exists.
- Product overlap appears low based on thread findings.

## Action
- Differentiate primarily on category and value proposition:
- "Security inspection and skill vetting for OpenClaw ecosystems"
- Local-first transparency and cost optimization

## Monitoring
Maintain a lightweight periodic check on similarly named repos to track potential brand/product collision.
