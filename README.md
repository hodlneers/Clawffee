# Clawffee ☕🦀  
**Coffee for AI**

Clawffee is a **local-first toolkit for AI operators**.

It helps you:
- inspect what an AI skill can actually do before you run it
- reduce risk when installing third-party tools
- improve efficiency and reduce wasted tokens
- introduce calm, optional pauses when systems benefit from one

No sermons.  
No moral scoring.  
No control layers.

Just practical tools that treat AI workflows with a bit more care.

## What Clawffee Is

Clawffee is built for people running **agentic systems** (like OpenClaw agents) who want:

- visibility instead of blind trust  
- efficiency instead of runaway costs  
- autonomy without chaos  

Clawffee does not tell agents how to behave.  
It gives *you* clearer information so you can decide.

Think of it as a quick coffee before you flip the switch.

## What Clawffee Does (v1)

### 🔍 Security Inspection & Skill Vetting
Before enabling a skill, Clawffee can show you:

- filesystem access (read / write / delete)
- shell command execution
- network access and external endpoints
- environment variable usage (including secrets)
- dynamic code execution or obfuscation signals
- dependency and supply-chain changes

Clawffee does **not** certify skills as safe or unsafe.  
It simply shows what’s there — clearly and locally.

---

### 💸 Token Efficiency (coming next)
Clawffee will help you understand:

- where tokens are being spent
- when agents are repeating themselves
- when context could be tightened or summarized
- when a short pause might improve output quality

Efficiency first.  
Care emerges naturally.

---

## What Clawffee Is Not

Clawffee is **not**:
- a moral authority
- a safety certification service
- a sandbox or enforcement layer
- a cloud surveillance tool
- a philosophical framework

It does not judge.  
It does not punish.  
It does not insist.

You can ignore it, remove it, or stop using it at any time.

---

## Local-First by Design

By default, Clawffee:
- runs entirely on your machine
- sends nothing to the cloud
- stores no prompts, secrets, or agent memory
- produces plain reports you can read or diff

This makes it ideal for:
- local OpenClaw setups
- Mac mini agent boxes
- sensitive credentials and real automation

---

## Why “Coffee for AI”

Coffee is:
- optional
- familiar
- non-authoritative
- taken when it helps

Clawffee works the same way.

Sometimes the best thing before action is a quick look, a pause, or a reset — not a rule.

## Project Status

- **v1**: Security Inspector & Skill Vetting (in progress)
- **v1.1**: Token usage & efficiency tooling
- Pause moments remain optional, lightweight, and non-enforced

See:
- `docs/Clawffee_v1_Security_Inspector_MVP.md`
- `docs/Clawffee_Roadmap_v1.0_to_v1.1.md`

---

## License & Use

Clawffee is designed to be:
- removable
- composable
- boring in the best way

Use it where it helps.  
Skip it where it doesn’t.
