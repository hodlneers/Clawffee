# 4. Clear Space Rules

Minimum clear space around the logo = 4 x seam stroke width.

For the 256px master grid:
- Seam stroke width = 10 units
- Minimum clear space = 40 units

Never place text, buttons, or other graphics inside this area.

Logo must always breathe.

- Minimum height: 48px

Below 48px:
- Use favicon/micro version

Favicon version:
- Safe down to 16px
- Ideal at 24px

Do not scale full-detail logo below 40px.

---

# 6. Do Not

Never:

- Stretch horizontally or vertically
- Rotate horizontally
- Add gradients
- Add glow effects
- Add drop shadows
- Change seam thickness
- Round seam corners
- Modify seam geometry
- Replace red with alternate shades
- Overlay on red backgrounds without contrast testing

If visual change is required, create a new version.

# 7. Grid Discipline

All logo exports must originate from the 256x256 master grid.

Always scale proportionally.

Never recreate logo manually in design tools.

---

# 8. Dark Mode Usage

On dark backgrounds:

Use:
- Dark bean (#1B1410)
- Red seam (#C62828)

Ensure sufficient contrast between background and bean.

Do not use pure black for dark UI backgrounds behind brown bean.

---

# 9. Monochrome Usage

Use monochrome versions for:

- Print
- Emboss
- CLI splash ASCII references
- Documentation diagrams

Do not mix mono and color versions in the same layout.

---

# 10. Future Evolution

This mark is Phase 1 (Retro Phase).

Future neon or holographic variants must:
- Preserve silhouette
- Preserve seam geometry
- Preserve vertical orientation

Geometry is permanent.
Color treatments may evolve intentionally.
