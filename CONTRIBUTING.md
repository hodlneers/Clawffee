## Project Values (Plain, Not Philosophical)

We try to keep Clawffee:
- **useful first**
- **calm by default**
- **non-authoritative**
- **easy to remove**
- **boring in a good way**

If a contribution adds clarity, reduces risk, or saves resources, it probably fits.

If it introduces enforcement, scoring, or moral framing, it probably doesn’t.

## What We Avoid (By Design)

Please avoid contributions that:
- enforce behavior or block execution
- certify skills as “safe” or “unsafe”
- assign moral or ethical scores
- add permanent background monitoring
- require cloud services by default
- collect or transmit user data
- anthropomorphize agents

Clawffee informs.  
It does not judge.
